Hi Mark

You can find all the code that I've used for verification and visualization here:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ht-MEvyao4GPm8VrE_IIByI3J1gsoEP4?usp=sharing#scrollTo=kBjilucoEZq3

The code produces the attached map.

If you have a Google Account, you may run this directly in Colab. You'll just need to upload the gifts.csv and any submission.csv. Let me know if you have any issues running it.

I think this would help future students to focus more on the algorithmic part of the challenge.

Best regards,
Dennis
